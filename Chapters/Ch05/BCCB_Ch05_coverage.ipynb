As we are diploid, we have 2 copies of each chromosome (and usually, of all genes within that chromosome). In the case of the sample we are analyzing (HG00096), it appears that this person is diploid for most of the region we are exploring, with the exception of *locus RHD*, which has half the coverage than the other genes.

    "Although the use of NGS has allowed us to narrow the positions of the breakpoints, we can try to be even more precise, defining the breakpoints at base-pair resolution. Considering the high coverage we have, and the fact that the reads lengths used are very long (250 bases), it is very likely that there are a couple of reads that cover the breakpoint. In this case, part of the read will belong to the left part of the breakpoint, while the rest of the read will belong to the sequence at the right-hand side (that is, 46,000 bases to the right). In this case, the alignment programs are not able to properly align the whole read. If part of the read aligns pretty well to a region, scanning the rest of the genome to try to find where the rest of the read aligns is very computing intensive, so it not usually done to keep the performance of the algorithm. In those cases, the read is aligned where there are more bases aligning, and then, it performs soft-clipping (the alignment will refer to the part that aligns, but not to the rest of the read). Those reads are known as **splitreads**. And those are precisely the ones we are interested in.\n",

However, if you take a look at the span, you can see that it does not span 250 bases (as it would be expected for a 250 bases read), but it spans 45,766 bases, which is exactly what you would expect if there was a deletion of $$45766-250 = 45516~bases$$ That means that this read lies right at the breakpoint, and the breapoint has been sequenced (in fact, it is this read). If we take a look at the BLAT alignment, we can see that the alignment is perfect, and you can define, at base-pair resolution, where the breakpoints are located, precisely at chr1:72,766,323 and at chr1:72,811,839.

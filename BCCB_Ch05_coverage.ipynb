    "You can see that the first hit is the only one that is able to align the total length of the read (250 bases), and it aligns with the 98.8% identity (the remaining results only align part of the read, as little as 20 bases, so they don't look as credible results). However, if you take a look at the span, you can see that it does not span 250 bases (as it would be expected for a 250 bases read), but it spans 45,766 bases, which is exactly what you would expect if there was a deletion of $$45766-250 = 45516~bases$$ That means that this read lies right at the breakpoint, and the breapoint has been sequenced (in fact, it is this read). If we take a look at the BLAT alignment, we can see that the alignment is perfect, and you can define, at base-pair resolution, where the breakpoints are located, precisely at chr1:72,766,323 and at chr1:72,811,839. You could now design a pair of primers to try to validate this finding by an orthogonal technique such as Sanger sequencing.\n",

    "In summary, this is the general procedure to detect CNVs and other structural variants from NGS data. However, there are specialized programs to detect CNVs by taking into consideration not only the number of reads, but the GC content and mappability of the region, improving the ability to detect CNVs. Similarly, the detection of SVs based on the combination of abnormally paired reads (discordant reads) as well as splitreads, allows the detection of different types of SVs (including duplications, inversions, translocations,...)"
